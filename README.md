Types of Network:-

There are four types of Networks:

LAN(Local Area Network)
PAN(Personal Area Network)
MAN(Metropolitan Area Network)
WAN(Wide Area Network)

Local Area Network
A computer network spanned inside a building and operated under single administrative system is generally termed as Local Area Network (LAN). Usually,LAN covers an organization’ offices, schools, colleges or universities. Number of systems connected in LAN may vary from as least as two to as much as 16 million.

LAN provides a useful way of sharing the resources between end users.The resources such as printers, file servers, scanners, and internet are easily sharable among computers.

Local Area Network
Characteristics of LAN
Here are the important characteristics of a LAN network:

It is a private network, so an outside regulatory body never controls it.
LAN operates at a relatively higher speed compared to other WAN systems.
There are various kinds of media access control methods like token ring and ethernet.
Advantages of LAN
Here are the pros/benefits of LAN:

Computer resources like hard-disks, DVD-ROM, and printers can share local area networks. This significantly reduces the cost of hardware purchases.
You can use the same software over the network instead of purchasing the licensed software for each client in the network.
Data of all network users can be stored on a single hard disk of the server computer.
You can easily transfer data and messages over networked computers.
It will be easy to manage data at only one place, which makes data more secure.
Local Area Network offers the facility to share a single internet connection among all the LAN users.
Disadvantages of LAN
Here are the cons/drawbacks of LAN:

LAN will indeed save cost because of shared computer resources, but the initial cost of installing Local Area Networks is quite high.
The LAN admin can check personal data files of every LAN user, so it does not offer good privacy.
Unauthorized users can access critical data of an organization in case LAN admin is not able to secure centralized data repository.
Local Area Network requires a constant LAN administration as there are issues related to software setup and hardware failures

Personal Area Network
A Personal Area Network (PAN) is smallest network which is very personal to a user. This may include Bluetooth enabled devices or infra-red enabled devices. PAN has connectivity range up to 10 meters. PAN may include wireless computer keyboard and mouse, Bluetooth enabled headphones, wireless printers and TV remotes.

Personal Area Network
For example, Piconet is Bluetooth-enabled Personal Area Network which may contain up to 8 devices connected together in a master-slave fashion.

Advantages of PAN
Here are the important pros/benefits of PAN network:

PAN networks are relatively secure and safe
It offers only short-range solution up to ten meters
Strictly restricted to a small area
Disadvantages of PAN
Here are the cons/drawbacks of using PAN network:

It may establish a bad connection to other networks at the same radio bands.
Distance limits.
Metropolitan Area Network
The Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) generally expands throughout a city such as cable TV network. It can be in the form of Ethernet,Token-ring, ATM, or Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).

Metro Ethernet is a service which is provided by ISPs. This service enables its users to expand their Local Area Networks. For example, MAN can help an organization to connect all of its offices in a city.

Metropolitan Area Network

Backbone of MAN is high-capacity and high-speed fiber optics. MAN works in between Local Area Network and Wide Area Network. MAN provides uplink for LANs to WANs or internet.

Characteristics of MAN
Here are important characteristics of the MAN network:

It mostly covers towns and cities in a maximum 50 km range
Mostly used medium is optical fibers, cables
Data rates adequate for distributed computing applications.
Advantages of MAN
Here are the pros/benefits of MAN network:

It offers fast communication using high-speed carriers, like fiber optic cables.
It provides excellent support for an extensive size network and greater access to WANs.
The dual bus in MAN network provides support to transmit data in both directions concurrently.
A MAN network mostly includes some areas of a city or an entire city.
Disadvantages of MAN
Here are drawbacks/cons of using the MAN network:

You need more cable to establish MAN connection from one place to another.
In MAN network it is tough to make the system secure from hackers
Wide Area Network
As the name suggests,the Wide Area Network (WAN) covers a wide area which may span across provinces and even a whole country. Generally, telecommunication networks are Wide Area Network. These networks provide connectivity to MANs and LANs. Since they are equipped with very high speed backbone, WANs use very expensive network equipment.

Wide Area Network
WAN may use advanced technologies such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame Relay, and Synchronous Optical Network (SONET). WAN may be managed by multiple administration.

Characteristics of WAN
Below are the characteristics of WAN:

The software files will be shared among all the users; therefore, all can access to the latest files.
Any organization can form its global integrated network using WAN.
Advantages of WAN
Here are the benefits/pros of WAN:

WAN helps you to cover a larger geographical area. Therefore business offices situated at longer distances can easily communicate.
Contains devices like mobile phones, laptop, tablet, computers, gaming consoles, etc.
WLAN connections work using radio transmitters and receivers built into client devices.
Disadvantages of WAN
Here are the drawbacks/cons of WAN network:

The initial setup cost of investment is very high.
It is difficult to maintain the WAN network. You need skilled technicians and network administrators.
There are more errors and issues because of the wide coverage and the use of different technologies.
It requires more time to resolve issues because of the involvement of multiple wired and wireless technologies.
Offers lower security compared to other types of network in computer.
TOPOLOGY:-



Network Topology is the schematic description of a network arrangement, connecting various nodes(sender and receiver) through lines of connection.
(or)
Topology refers to the arrangement or configuration of the components or nodes in a network.It determines how the nodes are connected and how the data flows between them.There are different types of network topologies.


BUS Topology
Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to single cable. When it has exactly two endpoints, then it is called Linear Bus topology.

Bus topology in computer networks

Features of Bus Topology
It transmits data only in one direction.
Every device is connected to a single cable
Advantages of Bus Topology
It is cost effective.
Cable required is least compared to other network topology.
Used in small networks.
It is easy to understand.
Easy to expand joining two cables together.
Disadvantages of Bus Topology
Cables fails then whole network fails.
If network traffic is heavy or nodes are more the performance of the network decreases.
Cable has a limited length.
It is slower than the ring topology.
RING Topology
It is called ring topology because it forms a ring as each computer is connected to another computer, with the last one connected to the first. Exactly two neighbours for each device.

Ring topology in computer networks

Features of Ring Topology
A number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with large number of nodes, because if someone wants to send some data to the last node in the ring topology with 100 nodes, then the data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach the 100th node. Hence to prevent data loss repeaters are used in the network.
The transmission is unidirectional, but it can be made bidirectional by having 2 connections between each Network Node, it is called Dual Ring Topology.
In Dual Ring Topology, two ring networks are formed, and data flow is in opposite direction in them. Also, if one ring fails, the second ring can act as a backup, to keep the network up.
Data is transferred in a sequential manner that is bit by bit. Data transmitted, has to pass through each node of the network, till the destination node.
Advantages of Ring Topology
Transmitting network is not affected by high traffic or by adding more nodes, as only the nodes having tokens can transmit data.
Cheap to install and expand
Disadvantages of Ring Topology
Troubleshooting is difficult in ring topology.
Adding or deleting the computers disturbs the network activity.
Failure of one computer disturbs the whole network.
STAR Topology
In this type of topology all the computers are connected to a single hub through a cable. This hub is the central node and all others nodes are connected to the central node.

Star topology in computer networks
Features of Star Topology
Every node has its own dedicated connection to the hub.
Hub acts as a repeater for data flow.
Can be used with twisted pair, Optical Fibre or coaxial cable.
Advantages of Star Topology
Fast performance with few nodes and low network traffic.
Hub can be upgraded easily.
Easy to troubleshoot.
Easy to setup and modify.
Only that node is affected which has failed, rest of the nodes can work smoothly.
Disadvantages of Star Topology
Cost of installation is high.
Expensive to use.
If the hub fails then the whole network is stopped because all the nodes depend on the hub.
Performance is based on the hub that is it depends on its capacity
MESH Topology
It is a point-to-point connection to other nodes or devices. All the network nodes are connected to each other. Mesh has n(n-1)/2 physical channels to link n devices.

There are two techniques to transmit data over the Mesh topology, they are :

Routing
Flooding
MESH Topology: Routing
In routing, the nodes have a routing logic, as per the network requirements. Like routing logic to direct the data to reach the destination using the shortest distance. Or, routing logic which has information about the broken links, and it avoids those node etc. We can even have routing logic, to re-configure the failed nodes.

MESH Topology: Flooding
In flooding, the same data is transmitted to all the network nodes, hence no routing logic is required. The network is robust, and the its very unlikely to lose the data. But it leads to unwanted load over the network.

Mesh topology in computer networks

Types of Mesh Topology
Partial Mesh Topology : In this topology some of the systems are connected in the same fashion as mesh topology but some devices are only connected to two or three devices.
Full Mesh Topology : Each and every nodes or devices are connected to each other.
Features of Mesh Topology
Fully connected.
Robust.
Not flexible.
Advantages of Mesh Topology
Each connection can carry its own data load.
It is robust.
Fault is diagnosed easily.
Provides security and privacy.
Disadvantages of Mesh Topology
Installation and configuration is difficult.
Cabling cost is more.
Bulk wiring is required.
TREE Topology
It has a root node and all other nodes are connected to it forming a hierarchy. It is also called hierarchical topology. It should at least have three levels to the hierarchy.

Tree topology in computer networks

Features of Tree Topology
Ideal if workstations are located in groups.
Used in Wide Area Network.
Advantages of Tree Topology
Extension of bus and star topologies.
Expansion of nodes is possible and easy.
Easily managed and maintained.
Error detection is easily done.
Disadvantages of Tree Topology
Heavily cabled.
Costly.
If more nodes are added maintenance is difficult.
Central hub fails, network fails.
HYBRID Topology
It is two different types of topologies which is a mixture of two or more topologies. For example if in an office in one department ring topology is used and in another star topology is used, connecting these topologies will result in Hybrid Topology (ring topology and star topology).

Hybrid topology in computer networks

Features of Hybrid Topology
It is a combination of two or topologies
Inherits the advantages and disadvantages of the topologies included
Advantages of Hybrid Topology

Effective.
Scalable as size can be increased easily.
Flexible.
Disadvantages of Hybrid Topology
Complex in design.
Costly.
OSI MODEL:-
OSI Model 7 layers - physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, application

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual model used to describe how data communication occurs between different systems. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the early 1980s to standardize communication protocols and promote interoperability between different computer systems.

The OSI model is divided into seven layers, each of which represents a different aspect of the communication process. These layers are as follows:

Physical Layer: This layer defines the physical aspects of the communication, such as the physical medium used for transmission (e.g. copper wires, optical fibers, etc.), the voltage levels used, and the physical connectors.

Data Link Layer: This layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data over a physical link, including error detection and correction, and flow control.

Network Layer: This layer is responsible for the routing of data packets between different networks, including addressing, packet forwarding, and congestion control.

Transport Layer: This layer provides end-to-end communication services, including reliability, flow control, and error recovery.

Session Layer: This layer manages the communication sessions between applications, including session establishment, maintenance, and termination.

Presentation Layer: This layer is responsible for the presentation of data to the application layer, including data encryption, compression, and formatting.

Application Layer: This layer represents the user-facing interface of the communication system, providing access to network services and applications.

Each layer of the OSI model builds upon the layers below it, with each layer encapsulating the data from the layer above it and passing it down to the layer below it. This layered approach allows for easy interoperability between different systems and provides a standardized framework for the development of communication protocols.

SLIDING WINDOW PROTOCOL:-

What is Sliding Window Protocol?

Sliding windows are a method of sending multiple frames at once. It manages data packets between the two devices, ensuring delivery of data frames reliably and gradually. It’s also found in TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).

Each frame is sent from the sequence number in this technique. The sequence numbers find use in the receiving end to locate missing data. The sequence number finds use in the sliding window technique in order to avoid duplicate data.

Working Principle of Sliding Window:
The sender’s buffer is the sending window, and the receiver’s buffer is the receiving window in these protocols.

Assignment of sequence numbers to frames is between the range 0 to 2n-1 if the frames’ sequence number is an n-bit field. As a result, the sending window has a size of 2n-1. As a result, we choose an n-bit sequence number to accommodate a sending window size of 2n-1.

Modulo-n is used to number the sequence numbers. If the sending window size is set as 3, the sequence numbers will be 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2 and so on.

The receiving window’s size refers to the maximum number of frames the receiver can accept at one time. It establishes the maximum number of frames a sender can send before receiving an acknowledgement.

Sliding Window (Sender and Receiver side):

a. Sender Side:
The sequence number of the frame occupies a field in the frame. So, the sequence number should be kept to a minimum.

The sequence number ranges from 0 to 2k-1 if the frame header allows k bits.

The sender maintains a list of sequence numbers that are only allowed to be sent by the sender.

The sender window can only be 2k-1 in size.

For example, if the frame allows 4 bits, the window’s size is 2 raised to the power 4 -1 16-1=15.

The sender has a buffer with the same size as the window.

b. Receiver Side:
On the receiver side, the size of the window is always 1.

The receiver acknowledges a frame by sending an ACK frame to the sender, along with the sequence number of the next expected frame.

The receiver declares explicitly that it is ready to receive N subsequent frames, starting with the specified number.

We use this scheme in order to acknowledge multiple frames.

The receiver’s window can hold 2,3,4 frames, but the ACK frame will be held until frame 4 arrives. It will send the

ACK along with sequence number 5 after the arrival, with which the acknowledgment of 2,3,4 will be done one at a time.

The receiver requires a buffer size of one.

Types of Sliding Window Protocols:
1. Go-Back-N ARQ:
The Go-Back-N Automatic Repeat Request protocol is also known as the Go-Back-N ARQ protocol. A sliding window method finds use in this data link layer protocol. In the event of corruption or loss of frames, all subsequent frames must be sent again.

In this protocol, the sender window size is N. The size of the receiver window is always one.

In the event of transmission of a corrupted frame, the receiver cancels it. The receiver does not accept a corrupted frame. The sender sends the correct frame again when the timer expires.

Example of Go-Back-N ARQ:
go back n arq

a. First, the sender sends the first four frames in the window (here the window size is 4).

working of go back n arq

 

b. Then, the receiver sends the acknowledgment for the 0th frame.

working of go back n arq steps

c. The receiver then slides the window over and sends the next frame in the queue.

working of go back n arq type

d. Accordingly, the receiver sends the acknowledgement for the 1st frame, and upon receiving that, the sender slides the window again and sends the next frame. This process keeps on happening until all the frames are sent successfully.

2. Selective Repeat ARQ:
Selective Repeat ARQ (Selective Repeat Automatic Repeat Request) is another name for Selective Repeat ARQ. A sliding window method is used in this data link layer protocol. If the frame has fewer errors, Go-Back-N ARQ works well. However, if the frame contains a lot of errors, sending the frames again will result in a lot of bandwidth loss. As a result, we employ the Selective Repeat ARQ method. The size of the sender window is always equal to the size of the receiver window in this protocol. The sliding window’s size is always greater than 1.

Example of Selective Repeat ARQ:
selective repeat arq

a. First, the sender sends the contents of the first window, which are frames 0 and 1 (because the window size is 2).

b. When the receiver receives the frames sent above, it sends an acknowledgment for frame 2 (because frame 2 is the frame it expects to receive next).

c. The sender then sends frames 2 and 3, however, frame 2 is lost on the way. The receiver thus sends back a “NAK” signal or a non-acknowledgment to let the sender know that frame 2 has been lost, and thus the sender retransmits frame 2.

Difference between Go-Back-N ARQ vs Selective Repeat ARQ:
Go-Back-N ARQ

Selective Repeat ARQ

All subsequent frames must be sent again if a frame is corrupted or lost.	Only the frame that has been corrupted or lost is sent again.
It wastes a lot of bandwidth if it has a high error rate.	There is less bandwidth loss.
It’s less complicated.	It’s more difficult because it requires sorting and searching. It also necessitates more storage.
It does not necessitate any sorting.	Sorting is done in this step to ensure that the frames are in the correct order.
It does not necessitate any searching.	It is where the search is carried out.
This is being used more frequently.	Because it is more complicated, it is used less frequently.
Advantages of Sliding Window Protocols:
1. It is possible to send multiple packets without receiving an acknowledgment.
2. Piggybacking with full-duplex lines is possible.

Disadvantages of Sliding Window Protocol:
1. This protocol does not impose any restrictions on sequence numbers.
2. In some cases, there may be a waste of bandwidth.

Summary
In this article, we looked at the concept of Sliding Window protocols, and also explored the two types of sliding window protocols: Go-Back-N ARQ and Selective Repeat ARQ. We covered the detailed working of each of the two types and also looked at the difference between the 2 protocols.

Guided Transmission Media in 
Twisted-pair cable, coaxial cable, and fiber-optic cable are examples of guided transmission media that offer a channel from one device to another. The physical boundaries of the medium direct and contain a signal flowing via any of these mediums.

Metallic (copper) conductors in twisted-pair and coaxial cable accept and convey signals in the form of electric current. Optical fibre is a type of cable that receives and transmits light signals.

Types of Guided Transmission Media:
1. Twisted Pair Cable:
This cable is the most often used and the least expensive. It is lightweight, inexpensive, and simple to install, and it supports a wide range of network types.

Twisted pairs are made up of 2 conductors (mostly copper), each with its own insulation, that are twisted together. One of these lines carries signals to the receiver, while the other serves merely as a ground reference. The difference between the two is used by the receiver to interpret signals.

In addition to the sender’s signal on one of the lines, interference may impact both wires and generate undesired signals. Because the two wires are in different positions relative to the noise sources, the effect of these undesirable signals is not the same in both wires if they are parallel. As a result, there is a difference at the receiver.

Types of Twisted Pair Cables:
a. Unshielded Twisted Pair Cable:
When compared to Shielded Twisted Pair Cable, which comprises two conductors, generally copper, each with its own colour plastic insulator, Unshielded Twisted Pair is the most prevalent kind of cable used in telecommunication.
UTP cables are made up of two or four pairs of twisted cables. RJ-11 connectors are used for two-pair cables, and RJ-45 connectors are used for four-pair cables.
Advantages of unshielded twisted pair cable:

Simple to set up.
Flexible
Cheap
Has a high speed capacity and a range of 100 metres.
Higher grade UTP is utilised in LAN technologies such as Ethernet.
Disadvantages of unshielded twisted pair cable:

Bandwidth is low when compared with the bandwidth of Coaxial Cable
Provides less protection from interference.
b. Shielded twisted pair cable:
Each pair of insulated conductors is encased in a metal foil or braided-mesh coating on this cable. Metal enclosure prevents electromagnetic noise from penetrating. Shielding also reduces crosstalk.
This exhibits the same attenuation as an unshielded twisted pair. It outperforms unshielded and coaxial cable in terms of speed. It costs more than coaxial and unshielded twisted pair.
Advantages of shielded twisted pair cable:

Installation is simple, and performance is sufficient.
It may be used for both analogue and digital transmission.
Increases the pace of signalling
Unshielded twisted pair has a higher capacity than protected twisted pair.
Crosstalk is eliminated.
Disadvantages of shielded twisted pair cable:

Manufacturing is difficult.
Heavy
Uses of Shielded Twisted Pair:

Voice and data channels are provided in telephone lines. The telephone companies’ DSL lines, which enable high-data-rate connections, also make use of the high-bandwidth capabilities of unshielded twisted-pair cables.
Twisted-pair cables are also used in Local Area Networks such as 10Base-T and 100Base-T.
2. Coaxial Cable:
Coaxial is so named because it has two conductors that are parallel to each other. Copper is utilised as the centre conductor in this, which can be a solid wire or a normal wire. It is encircled by a PVC installation, a sheath, and an outside conductor made of metal foil, metal braid, or both.
The outer copper wrapping serves as a noise barrier as well as the second conductor that completes the circuit. An insulating layer surrounds the outside conductor as well. The plastic cover on the outside covers the whole cable.
Types of Coaxial Cable:
a. Baseband Coaxial cable:
This is a coaxial cable with a resistance of 50 ohms () that is used for digital transmission. It is mostly used for LANs. Baseband transmits a single signal at a time at a high rate. The main disadvantage is that it requires amplification every 1000 feet.

b. Broadband Coaxial Cable:
This is accomplished through the use of analogue transmission over conventional cable television wiring. It sends several signals at the same time at various frequencies. When compared to Baseband Coaxial Cable, it covers a larger region.

Advantages of broadband coaxial cable:

The bandwidth is really large.
Long-distance telephone lines make use of this term.
Digital signals are sent at a very high rate of 10Mbps.
Significantly improved noise immunity
Transmission of data with no distortion.
Because they have greater insulation than twisted pair cable, they can traverse longer distances at higher speeds.
Disadvantages of broadband coaxial cable:

A single cable failure may bring the entire network to a halt.
When compared to twisted pair, it is more difficult to install and more costly.
If the shield is not flawless, it might result in a grounded loop.
Uses of Coaxial Cable:

Coaxial cable is used in analog telephone networks, with a single coaxial network capable of carrying 10,000 voice transmissions.
These are also used in cable TV networks. Coaxial cable was utilised across the conventional cable TV network. Cable television employs RG-59 coaxial cable.
In standard Ethernet LANs. Coaxial cable was selected for digital transmission in early Ethernet LANs due to its large bandwidth and, as a result, high data rate. 10Base-2, also known as Thin Ethernet, uses RG-58 coaxial cable with BNC connections to transport data at 10Mbps over a distance of 185 metres.
3. Fibre Optic Cable:
Fibre optic is a cable that contains optical fibres coated in plastic and is used to transmit data via light pulses.
The plastic covering shields the optical fibres from heat, cold, and electromagnetic interference caused by other types of wiring.

Fibre optics transmit data at a quicker rate than copper cables.

Parts of Fibre Optic Cable:
a. Core:
The optical fibre is made up of a thin strand of glass or plastic known as the core. A core is the portion of the fibre that transmits light. The larger the core area, the more light will be transferred into the fibre.

b. Cladding:
Cladding refers to the concentric layer of glass. The primary and foremost function of the cladding is to create a lower refractive index at the core interface, thereby causing reflection within the core and allowing light waves to pass through the fibre.

c. Jacket:
A jacket is a type of protective covering made of plastic. The primary function of a jacket is to retain fibre strength, absorb stress, and provide further fibre protection.

Advantages of fibre optic cable:

Greater Bandwidth: When compared to copper, fibre optic cable delivers greater bandwidth. As a result, fibre optic cable can carry more data than copper wire.
Faster data transmission: Fibre optic cable transmits data in the form of light. This enables the fibre optic cable to transport signals at a faster rate.
Larger lengths: When compared to copper cable, fibre optic cable transports data across longer distances.
Better reliability: Fiber optic cable is more dependable than copper cable since it is resistant to temperature fluctuations, which can create obstructions in copper cable communication.
Thinner and more robust: Because fibre optic cable is thinner and lighter in weight, it can resist more draw pressure than copper wire.
Summary:
In this article, we looked at the various types of guided transmission media that are available, and also the advantages and disadvantages of each. We also covered the components within each cable, and also the use cases of these cables.
